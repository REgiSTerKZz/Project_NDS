# Project_NDS
College project using the NDS emulator.

## Information

I use the Visual Studio Code and the debugger to avoid having to install the emulator. The emulator the game uses is embeded in the Visual Studio Code so there is no need for it's installation.

Also, this give the option to peak at the code!

## Installation

1. The folder has to be in the C: drive to work properly.
`C:\ndside` 
2. Once the folder is in the main drive, execute the `vscode.bat`
3.  a Visual Studio Code instance should appear.
4. Make sure the folder `animate_simple`is opened in the visual code. 
	`File->Open Folder`
5. Once the folder is loaded in Visual Studio Code, execute the Debug instance using `F5`or `Debug -> Start Debugging` in Visual Studio. 
6. Play!


## Game

This is the recreation of the classic game where a fruit falls down and a basket in the bottom of the screen has to catch it before it falls to the ground.

Here is a picture of it: <br/>

If an Apple hits the ground or a Bomb hits the basket, a live is taken from the player.
